# RaspberryPiHumidor
Project for creating a smart humidor with a Raspberry Pi

I wanted to make sure that instead of me having to check if my humidor is humid enough, my humidor would tell me that it needs to be refilled. In order to guarantee a perfect humdity, always.

Hence this project. A Raspberry PI W Zero combined with an AM2302 DHT22 humidity sensor. And some simple code to make sure an e-mail is send when the humidity drops below a certain level
